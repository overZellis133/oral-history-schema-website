My mother's side of the family were farmers and had a farm in the east coast of the US, New Hampshire. And I spent a lot of times there. In fact, if you look at sort of my early life, the time I spent in summers working on the farm was part of what helped me become an engineer. My dad was an electrical engineer and so I sort of followed in his footsteps. That was my, you know, sort of goal a whole life was to follow in his footsteps and also be an electrical engineer. But I spent the summers working on the family farm in New Hampshire, you know, baling hay, doing, you know, everything around the place. And I developed this tendency to just fix things. It's part of what drove me to be an engineer.",

You had to just fix things yourself. And so my whole life, that's how I kind of approach things, which is just learn to do whatever needs to be done and be hands-on and fix things. And what about your mom? What did she do? My mom is a nurse. She grew up on the farm and then she was able to go to nursing school and she became a nurse.

And so I was lucky to have this exposure early on that this interesting thing was happening and I wanted to learn. And so I was a kid who always was experimenting with sort of basic electronics. I had the little kits as a kid where you would build the radio from scratch or you would wire together a little electronic circuits.
